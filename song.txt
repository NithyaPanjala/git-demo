Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?


It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
